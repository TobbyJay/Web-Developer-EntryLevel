	 <p class="p"><b>Passion,</b>becoming a Web/Software developer has always been my aspiration,and due to this im willing to do all i can in order to achieve this,i'm a <b>Good Listener </b>and i love <b>Following</b> given and specific  <b>Instructions</b> to the latter,i dislike laziness as i am <b>not Lazy</b> because i am always ready to learn,im also a <b>Problem Solver</b>, a requirement i believe all developers should have,plus im a <b>deep thinker</b> and <b>Lover Of Art</b>,now combining art and coding will really help in building a beautiful website/web-app that users will love and be able to easily interact with,now thats the beauty and joy of going into web development and being a Web Developer too.<b>And i would like to be Brutally Honest,</b>when it comes to ones passion and love for something, i believe one shouldn't pursue it because of the Money or currency involved,and this is same with me lately,i believe passion beats currency,surprisingly i pick passion over money which might seem funny,i'm also a <b>Good communicator</b> and i love being in a team because i know i will learn a lot from people. Lastly, i believe with the little knowledge i have so far which is still a basic knowledge of <b>HTML and CSS</b> can be turned into Gold and Nurtured based on the Experience that i will gain if i'm being accepted for this post of an Entry Level Web Developer. </p>
